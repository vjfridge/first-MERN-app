# first-MERN-app
My first web application using the MERN (MongoDB Express React Node) stack. 

# Description
A simple todo web application with MongoDB CRUD functionality for todo items. Source code developed from following [The MERN Stack Tutorial â€“ Building A React CRUD Application From Start To Finish](https://codingthesmartway.com/the-mern-stack-tutorial-building-a-react-crud-application-from-start-to-finish-part-4/) by Sebastian on [CodingTheSmartWay.com](https://codingthesmartway.com/).
